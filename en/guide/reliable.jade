  h3(id='reliable') Reliable provisional responses

  p.
    Responding to a SIP INVITE with a reliable provisional response is easy: just add a <code>Require: 100rel</code> header to the INVITE request and drachtio-server will handle that for you.  However, after sending a response reliably, your app should wait for the PRACK to be received before sending the final response.  This can be done by providing a handler in the <code>req.prack()</code> method.

  +js.
    app.invite(function(req, res) {
      res.send( 183,{
        headers: {
          require: '100rel'
          ,supported: '100rel'
        }
        ,body: config.sdp
      }) ;

      req.prack( function(prack) {
        // send final response now that we have received PRACK
        res.send( 200, {body: config.sdp} ) ;
      }) ;
    }) ;

  blockquote
    Note that if you want to use reliable provisional responses if the remote side supports them, but establish the call without them if the remote side does not support it, then include a `Supported` header but do not include a `Require` header.

  p.
    Similiarly, if you want to send reliable provisional responses, just add a <code>Require: 100rel</code> header in your response, and drachtio-server will handle sending reliable provisional response for you.
